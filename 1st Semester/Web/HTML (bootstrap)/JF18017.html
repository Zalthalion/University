    <p class="lead text-justify">
        <em>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</em> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
        of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of 
        the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    </p>   
    <p class="text-justify">
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
        colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility
        and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to 
        share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity 
        and repetition in the structural content.    
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in 
        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice 
        (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has 
        rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule 
        applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme 
        is predictable. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. Internet media 
        type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C 
        operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.

            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/54/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie.jpg/170px-H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie.jpg" class="img-thumbnail float-right d-inline-flex mr-2 ml-2" alt="Håkon Wium Lie">
    <p class="text-justify">
        CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with 
        Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the 
        same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted 
        in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal 
        was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup 
        Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement 
        for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, 
        existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's 
        style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different 
        style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of these nine proposals, two were especially 
        influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP). 
        Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave 
        Raggett's Arena browser. Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser. Thereafter, Lie and Bos 
        worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could 
        also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).
    </p>
            <h1 id="C2"><a href="#C0" class="text-dark">Syntax</a></h1>
    <p class="text-justify">
        CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties. 
        A style sheet consists of a list of <em>rules</em>. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more <em>selectors</em>, and a <em>declaration block</em>.
    </p>
            <h1 id="C3"><a href="#C0" class="text-dark">Selector</a></h1>
    <p class="text-justify">
        In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Selectors may apply to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
        <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:
          <ul>
            <li><i>id</i>: an identifier unique within the document</li>
            <li><i>class</i>: an identifier unique within the document</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
      </ul>
    <p class="text-justify">
        <em>Pseudo-classes</em> are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is 
        not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>, which 
        identifies content only when the user “points to” the visible element, usually by holding the mouse 
        cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in <code>a:hover</code> or <code>#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class 
        classifies document elements, such as <code>:link</code> or <code>:visited</code>, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection 
        that may consist of partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or <code>::first-letter</code>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.

    <p class="text-justify">
        Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. 
        All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, 
        often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style 
        sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings 
        had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more 
        complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from 
        structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic 
        characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, 
        such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The advantages of this may not be immediately clear (since the second form is actually more verbose), but the power of CSS becomes 
        more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, 
        suppose the document contains the style element:
    </p><pre><code> 
    &lt; style &gt; 
            h1 {color: red;} 
    &lt; /style &gt;  
        </code></pre><p>
        All <code>h1</code> elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted 
        to make <code>h1</code> elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    &lt; style &gt; 
            h1{color: blue;} 
    &lt; /style &gt; 
        </code></pre>
    <p class="text-justify">
        rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual <code>h1</code> element.
    </p>
    <h1 id="C5"><a href="#C0" class="text-dark">Positioning</a></h1>
    <p class="text-justify">CSS 2.1 defines three positioning schemes:</p>
    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Normal flow</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
            <em>Inline</em> items are laid out in the same way as the letters in words in text, one after the other across the available 
            space until there is no more room, then starting a new line below. Block items stack vertically, like paragraphs and 
            like the items in a bulleted list. Normal flow also includes relative positioning of block or inline items, and run-in boxes.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3 ">Floats</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
            A floated item is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available. 
            Other content then flows alongside the floated item.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Absolute positioning</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
            An absolutely positioned item has no place in, and no effect on, the normal flow of other items. It occupies its assigned 
            position in its container independently of other items.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Position property</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
            There are four possible values of the <code>position</code> property. If an item is positioned in any way other than <code>static</code>, then 
            the further properties <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> are used to specify offsets and positions.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Static</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
            The default value places the item in the <em>normal flow</em>
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Relative</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
            The item is placed in the <em>normal flow</em>, and then shifted or offset from that position. Subsequent flow items are laid 
            out as if the item had not been moved.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Absolute</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
                Specifies <em>absolute positioning</em>. The element is positioned in relation to its nearest non-static ancestor.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-3">Fixed</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-9 text-justify">
                The item is <em>absolute positioned</em> in a fixed position on the screen even as the rest of the document is scrolled
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h1 id="C6"><a href="#C0" class="text-dark">Limitations</a></h1>
    <p class="text-justify">Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Selectors are unable to ascend</dt>
        <dd class="text-justify">CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an element that satisfies certain criteria. CSS Selectors 
        Level 4, which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a selector, but only as part of the "complete" selector 
        profile, not the "fast" profile used in dynamic CSS styling. A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would enable 
        more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for the CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent 
        selectors are related to browser performance and incremental rendering issues.</dd>

        <dt>Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position</dt>
        <dd class="text-justify">Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with a position:absolute or position:relative 
        attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is 
        forced to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.</dd>

        <dt>Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable</dt>
        <dd class="text-justify">CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, 
        "<code>:hover</code>", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for abuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups), 
        but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no "nochange"-like values for each property).</dd>

        <dt>Cannot name rules</dt>
        <dd class="text-justify">There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.</dd>

        <dt>Cannot target specific text without altering markup</dt>
        <dd class="text-justify">Besides the <code>:first-letter</code> pseudo-element, one cannot target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize place-holder elements.</dd>
